# Final game of 2020
I created this game in 3 hours just before the start of 2021. The first commit contains that code I wrote then. It is still in the early stages, so feel free to download and change it how you like!

## Todo

* Split into multiple files.

* Add high score functionality.

* Remove bullets when they exit the screen.

* Create a cool name for this.
